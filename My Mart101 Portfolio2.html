<p> Week 1, I started the Mart 101 Creative Coding Class taught by Michael Cassens.<br>
     My first assignmnent was writing a short paper on the differences of GUI Vs. CLI. <br>
     I was a total noob to coding then. Now I know a little more! I'm more of a noob level 2!<br>
     Now I can't say for sure If I have the same opinion as I did when I wrote that! I really love the creative side of things. </p> 
     <br>

     <p> <img src="week2screenshot.png"                height="400" width="400"></p>
     <p>Week 2, I took some online qizes, took online tutorials at the artist lab website, and used the artist lab to create this final creation.<br>
     I experiented a bunch with this lab. I found a lot of cool shapes while just messing around! I used this one because it reminded me of the U.S flag.<br>
     I eventually want to be able to make some of the amazing, abstract art that I've seen. </p>
     <br>

     <p><img src="Screenshot 2020-11-20 142653.png" height="400" width="400"></p>
     <p>Week 3, this week we talked about grit, and explored the world of scratch. <br>
         I had a rough time learning scratch and it took me awhile. But eventually I figured it out, and created something I'm proud of.<br>
        To get  full credit, I had to make the characters move quite a bit, but I couldn't figure out when to move them! I had a story in mind and It didn't involve movement.<br>
         I finally found a solution, by moving the character while they talked it didn't ruin the story. It actually made it smoother!</p>

         <p> Week 4, this week we worked on making apps and little games. We used an website and a drag and drop method to make them.<br>
             I probably struggled the most with the art app, but I'm happy I finished it because it's me favorite of the two!<br>
            The funny part about the game, was that before I made it. I really want to make a bigger zombie game.<br>
             It is a hope of mine that I can do that someday!</p>

         <p><img src="week 5 screenshot.png" height="400" width="400"></p>
         <p> Week 5, this week we used a new program called Alice. Alice was pretty simple and easy to use. I loved making the Walruses. I decided to make the story by accident after creating 12 different Walruses!
             <br> I really tried to make the background more interesting and follow the story but couldn't quite get exactly what I wanted. <br>
             I enjoyed making the story, and Mr. Michael Cassens said he liked it too!  </p>

         <p> Week 6, 7, and 8 we were using website pages that we created to practice using html, style, and script. I loved making these pages, although I did have trouble with the 3rd page.<br>
             Week 6 we made the original pages, then in Week 7, we styled the pages and learned how to change colors, formats, and a lot of other things.<br>
              In Week 8, we mostly worked on the functionality of the 3rd page.(The one I struggled with the most!)</p>

              <p><img src="Week 9 screenshot.png" height="400" width="400"></p><br>
              <p> Week 9 and 10 we worked on a portrait using still shapes. I used the design of a minecraft character for inspiration.<br>
                On Week 10 we worked on animating the shapes to move across the screen.<br>
            Even though making the shapes move was incredibly hard, that project is the one I'm most proud of. </p>

            <p> Week 11, We started a new project. The project was making a little mini-game. We made a moveable character, little enemies that drifted across the screen.<br>
            On week 12 we expirimented with functions and calling them. We organized our code, and I learned a lot about functions from that.<br>
        On week 13, our final week, we learned about arrays and how to implement them. We implemented them in our Week 12 work and made it look AWESOME!</p>
