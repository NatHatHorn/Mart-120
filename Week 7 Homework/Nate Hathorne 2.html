   <span style="color: black;"> <br> A gentleman was walking through an elephant camp, and he spotted that the elephants weren’t being kept in cages
    or held by the use of chains.
    All that was holding them back from escaping the camp, was a small piece of rope tied to one of their legs.
    As the man gazed upon the elephants, he was completely confused as to why the elephants didn’t just use their
    strength to break the rope and escape the camp. They could easily have done so, but instead, they didn’t try to at
    all.
    Curious and wanting to know the answer, he asked a trainer nearby why the elephants were just standing there and
    never tried to escape.
    <p><span>The trainer replied;
        “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough
        to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can
        still hold them, so they never try to break free.” </span> </p>
    The only reason that the elephants weren’t breaking free and escaping from the camp was that over time they adopted
    the belief that it just wasn’t possible.

    <p> <div id="myID">This is exactly why I feel having a growth Mindset is so important! People will asume since they tried something
        and failed once, that they won't ever be able to succed. Just as the elaphants gave up people do too. But, just
        as the elaphants grew bigger, as can a persons abilities and creativity.</div></p>
